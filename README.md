help insert images, as well as numpy.

### About
This project takes 4 infinite series which converge to Pi,
compares how accurate they are, and graphs their behavior.

### File
legend.PNG - describes mathematical formulae used, Make sure it is in the
same directory as Visualizing_Pi when running

testing_pi_approximations.py - python code used to initially test
that all of the pi-approximating functions worked

Visualizing_Pi.py - Main program

### Usage
Run program:
```bash
python Visualizing_Pi.py
```
